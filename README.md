# Pipboy

Website themed on pipboy console from fallout 4

Here is a small project that I have done when following a Udemy course.
The project has 2 working tabs. The stats and Inventory tabs.

The stats bar has one working tab which is the status tab. It briefly describes 
how the player is doing, showing level progress, HP, AP and damage done to its
armor. Also show Energy level, radiation and damage.

The inventory has also one tab working which is the weapons tab.
The weapons tab displays 3 different weapons and their stats. The stats change
when each weapon is hovered over.

I used bootstrap and jQuery during this project. As I was following the examples
given in the tutorials I came across few difficulties such as out-dated features
that bootstrap did not have or have been changed due to different version. A lot
of the code did not match the outcome on the screen of the tutorial, so I decided 
to read more of bootstrap documentation and complete the project my own way in 
which I understood it rather than following the tutorial step by step as it was
confusing and more complicated.
